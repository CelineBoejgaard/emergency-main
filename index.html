  I started waking up early on vacation — and discovered the beach feels completely different at sunrise
</h3>
<p>
  I used to think beach mornings were for sleeping in, but one day, jet lag had other plans. I found myself walking toward the water just after dawn, coffee in hand, expecting emptiness. Instead, I found something better — quiet beauty and a version of the beach I’d never seen before.

            <h3>
              My beach getaway to Portugal didn’t go as planned, but stormy
              skies helped me discover the heart of the Algarve
            </h3>
            <p>
              I booked a five-day escape to the Algarve in southern Portugal,
              dreaming of warm sun, turquoise water, and lazy afternoons by the
              beach. I’d picked a charming boutique hotel in Lagos, with a
              balcony that overlooked the cliffs and ocean. My plan was simple:
              sunbathe, swim, repeat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the universe had other ideas. The moment I landed,
              the sky turned gray and the wind began to howl. Locals told me the
              region was experiencing an unusually long Atlantic storm front — a
              rarity in late spring. My plans for sun-soaked days by the water
              vanished overnight.
            </p>
            <p>
              The beaches were closed due to rough tides, and even the seaside
              restaurants pulled their tables inside. For a moment, I thought
              I’d wasted my vacation days on a washout. But as the days went on,
              I realized the bad weather had given me something even better: the
              chance to experience the Algarve beyond its beaches.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Once I stopped chasing the sun, I found a deeper connection to the
              place — and to myself
            </h3>
            <p>
              Determined not to let the rain win, I swapped my swimsuit for a
              rain jacket and started exploring. I joined a local cooking class
              in the old town of Lagos, where a grandmotherly chef taught us how
              to make cataplana, a traditional seafood stew. The kitchen was
              warm, the laughter was louder than the thunder outside, and it
              felt like the real Portugal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also spent time wandering through cobbled streets, visiting
              pottery studios, and ducking into cafés filled with locals instead
              of tourists. One rainy evening, I found a tiny wine bar tucked
              under an archway, where the owner poured me a glass of vinho verde
              and talked about how the ocean shaped every part of Algarve life.
            </p>
            <p>
              On my last day, the clouds finally broke, and I managed to walk
              along the cliffs of Ponta da Piedade under a glowing sunset. It
              felt like a reward — but honestly, I didn’t need it. The storm had
              already made the trip unforgettable.
            </p>

            <h3>
              The bad weather reminded me that sometimes the best travel moments
              aren’t the ones we plan
            </h3>
            <p>
              Sure, I missed out on beach time, but I gained stories, flavors,
              and friendships I never would’ve found otherwise. I learned that
              travel isn’t about perfect conditions — it’s about curiosity and
              flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next time, I might check the forecast a little more carefully. But
              I also know that if the weather turns, it’s not the end of a
              vacation — it might just be the beginning of a better one.

          <h3>Beach drinks?</h3>

            How learning to make my own beach drinks helped me bring vacation
            vibes anywhere

              I used to think beach days were only about sunbathing — until I
              discovered how much more there is to do
            </h3>
            <p>
              For years, my beach trips looked the same: towel, sunscreen, and
              hours of doing nothing. It was relaxing, sure, but after a while,
              I started to wonder what I was missing. So on my last trip, I made
              a promise to try a few new things — and it completely changed how
              I spend my time by the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              One morning, I joined a group for a sunrise yoga class right on
              the sand. The sound of waves replaced music, and it was the
              calmest start to a day I’ve ever had. Later, I rented a
              paddleboard, something I’d always been nervous to try. I fell in
              twice, laughed the whole time, and loved it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, I still bring my towel and sunscreen, but I also pack a
              frisbee, a book, and a curious mindset. Because the best beach
              days aren’t just about lying still — they’re about making memories
              in the sand.

              I learned how to make the perfect beach drinks — and now I can
              bring vacation vibes anywhere
            </h3>
            <p>
              Every time I go on a beach trip, I look forward to sipping
              something cold, colorful, and a little bit tropical. There’s
              something about a good drink — the clink of ice, the scent of
              citrus — that instantly makes me feel like I’m on vacation. But I
              realized I didn’t have to wait for my next getaway to enjoy that
              feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              This summer, instead of spending money on pricey cocktails at
              beach bars, I decided to learn how to make my own. My goal was
              simple: create drinks that taste just as good by the ocean as they
              do in my own backyard.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a small experiment turned into a full-blown hobby.
              I learned that the secret to a great beach drink isn’t just the
              alcohol — it’s balance, freshness, and a little creativity.
            </p>

            <h3>
              I started with simple, refreshing ingredients — and found that
              less is more
            </h3>
            <p>
              The first drink I tried to master was a classic mojito. I muddled
              mint, lime, and sugar before adding a splash of rum and soda
              water. It was light, refreshing, and exactly what I wanted under
              the sun. From there, I started swapping ingredients to mix things
              up — basil instead of mint, grapefruit instead of lime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came the mocktails. My favorite? Coconut water, pineapple
              juice, and a squeeze of lime served over crushed ice. It tastes
              like a tropical breeze and keeps you hydrated, which makes it
              perfect for beach days.
            </p>
            <p>
              I even found ways to prep ahead. I’d mix big batches of base
              ingredients — like fresh juice blends or homemade simple syrup —
              in glass bottles. That way, I could pour a quick drink wherever I
              was, whether that was a picnic, a balcony, or a spot in the sand.
            </p>

            <h3>The best beach drinks don’t need a beach at all</h3>
            <p>
              Once I got the hang of it, I started inviting friends over for
              “sunset hour.” We’d play beachy music, pour drinks into colorful
              glasses, and pretend we were on an island. It wasn’t about the
              setting — it was about the mood.
            </p>
            <p>
              My go-to recipes are now a mix of fruity, fizzy, and fun. Think:
              watermelon spritzes, ginger-lime coolers, and frozen mango
              margaritas. The trick is using real fruit, plenty of ice, and
              something sparkling for that instant vacation vibe.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still love ordering a cocktail by the ocean when I travel. But
              learning how to make my own has been even more satisfying. No
              matter where I am — a beach, a park, or my kitchen — one sip and
              I’m right back on holiday.
